                <p>Dr.James Widjaja, Sunday, March 10 20:42 pm at Shanghai,China</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>The Zap is a family mixed from an African bird called Hamerkop bird which has a special power to support 100 times over their weight protecting their adult bringing their nests. Also, the Zap is a mix of a Painted Frogfish from the deep sea that has a characteristic to camouflage. The Zap is called a species of Scopus Pictus because one time a Hammerkop bird was trying to get a food dipping inside of the sea and ate the painted frogfish. Eventually, the Hamerkop bird's DNA was poised from the Painted Frogfish, blended a new-mixed family from Anteariidae and Umbretta family and flew to sea space. At last, the species is called Scopus Pictus which became a creature that flies, protects, and camouflages in the sea space.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>FAs a creature of Zap, they live in sea space that contains shooting stars coming from different universes. The sea space is surrounded by the four Red Octa Planet, Blue Victa Planet, and Green Mucto Planet, and Yellow Zecto Planet, which are the homes of the Zaps based on their breed of the Zaps. The Zaps can be either an eater of flame in Planet Octa, plasma in Planet Victa, wind in Planet Mucto, and thunder in Planet Zecto. Whenever the Zap passes through the planets, the Zap is sending energy to make the planets live. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>TThe Zap has a unique body shape which includes radiation around the body and wings. The function of the radiation is to store energy that is obtained from the lights of the stars. One fun fact is Zaps only have one eye because on the earth before the two creatures merged, local piranhas were stealing the Painted Frogfishâ€™s one eye as a food. Currently, the only eye is used to ensure the target potential light source of stars and it will share the energy to each planet.</p>

                The Zap is an artificial creature which originated from an African Hamerkop bird eating the Painted Frogfish in the deep sea which eventually made a new family of Anteariidae and Umbretta family of Scopus Pictus. The Zap eventually lives in the sea space and creates habitats of the Flame Red Octa, Plasma Blue Victa, Wind Green Mucto, and Thunder Yellow Zecto based on what they eat. Zaps are a flying creature that give energy from the light source of stars with targeting using only their eyes which makes them special to live!

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>                <ul>
                    <li>Touch the Zap whenever you feel that the Zap is facing too many attacks of plasma so that it can camouflage and change its color</li>
                    <li> Press the right arrow in the keyboard to change the moods of the sea space from black, blue, purple, and orange</li>
                    <li>WARNING! Don't get too dizzy looking at their eyeballs because they are always watching for the lightsource of stars
                    </li>
